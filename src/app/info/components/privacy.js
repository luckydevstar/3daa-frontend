    <p className="p-b-20">
      The Company takes reasonable steps to ensure the accuracy of the Personal
      Data being collected and stored. However, it may not always be possible to
      ensure that all Personal Data collected and stored is accurate at all
      times. Members can update their Personal Data in the settings page of
      their account. Otherwise, Personal Data can be updated by emailing
      {config.email} or by calling us on {config.phoneNumber}. Please note that
      it may take up to 21 days for the relevant changes to take place after

      completely secure. Although the Company will do its best to protect your
      Personal Data, we cannot guarantee the security of any information that is
      transmitted to our website and applications; any such transmission is

      You have the right to ask the Company not to process your Personal Data
      for marketing purposes. We will usually inform you (before collecting any
      information from you) if we intend to use your Personal Data for such
      purposes or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party
