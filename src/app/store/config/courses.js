All staff working in the food industries must have an understanding of hygiene and safety for their working environments and this is particularly true of cellar work, where not only is hygienic presentation important, staff must also wear suitable protective clothing. Security is especially important in the cellar to protect against theft and abuse of expensive commodities. This will involve securing the cellar area and also checking that goods received are correct so that there can be no loss because of short or inappropriate deliveries. This unit also covers the rotation of stock and the issue of drinks given to other staff members in the hospitality business to further ensure that drinks are not wasted or stolen. Finally, learners will look in detail at the documentation needed and how to deal with unexpected situations that might arise.',
